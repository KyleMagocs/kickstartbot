# kickstartbot

Dumb little script that just pulls down a kickstarter page every couple minutes, checks the new $$ total, and sends messages to a slack bot to update everyone on the progress.

Pretty dumb.  Pretty straight forward.  If you want to use it you'll need to create a kickstarter bot and get the unique post endpoint to send messages, as well as change the address of the Kickstarter it's looking at

And y'know, change out all the emoji and messages for new totals and stuff
